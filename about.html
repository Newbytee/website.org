<div class="title">What is it</div>
<div class="text">
<i>Kontalk</i> is an effort to write an instant messaging system &ndash; primarly
designed for embedded devices, especially smartphones.<br/>
It would be cross-platform, though there is only an Android client for now.
iOS, Symbian and even a desktop client will be coming soon.
</div>
</div>

<div class="diver">
<div class="title">The network</div>
<div class="text">
<b><i>Kontalk</i> is not owned by anyone</b>. The network is run by the
community for the community, in a network of servers that can expand virtually
to infinity.<br/>
We believe communication is a human right; therefore, anyone on the planet
should be able to connect freely and for free. <i>Kontalk</i> is designed to be
free and to remain as such <b><u>forever</u></b>.
</div>
</div>

<div class="diver">
<div class="title">Distributed network</div>
<div class="text">
The <i>Kontalk</i> network can continue running even if just one of the servers is up.
The network itself is designed to not allow any single point of failure and it
protects itself from broken servers.
</div>
</div>

<div class="diver">
<div class="title">Security</div>
<div class="text">
All data exchanged inside the <i>Kontalk</i> network is <b>encrypted</b>, and
user IDs are always hashed, so that even the server owners cannot retrieve the
phone number of a user.
</div>
</div>

<div class="diver">
<div class="title">Lightweight protocol</div>
<div class="text">
<i>Kontalk</i> protocol has been designed from scratch to be very lightweight
and to consume very low network traffic in client-to-server communication. All
the specifications are available at <a href="protocol.html">this page</a>.
</div>
</div>

<div class="diver">
<div class="title">Web of Trust</div>
<div class="text">
The <i>Kontalk</i> network of servers is public: anyone can join with their own
server. A server is untrusted at the beginning; by means of a vote system
&ndash; based on strong asymmetric encryption &ndash; and by working actively in
the network it can become a trusted server and get more privileges.
