                <span class="info-box-label">What is XMPP?</span>
                Quoting from xmpp.org:
                <blockquote>
                The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an
                open technology for real-time communication, which powers a
                wide range of applications including instant messaging,
                presence, multi-party chat, voice and video calls,
                collaboration, lightweight middleware, content syndication,
                and generalized routing of XML data.
                </blockquote>
                Shortly, XMPP is a protocol and a set of rules for routing
                XML messages. It's extensible, it's standard, and it's
                widely supported by the community and industry.
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <span class="info-box-label">Why XMPP?</span>
                Mainly because it's a standard: this will bring many benefits,
                one of them is clients will be easier to develop. Also it will
                be possible to chat with other Jabber users (e.g. GTalk).
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <span class="info-box-label">Not 100% compliant</span>
                Because of the nature of the <i>Kontalk</i> network, our
                implementation will be slightly out of standard &mdash;
                however still 100% compatible with all XMPP clients. Some glue
                will be implemented in order to make the protocol more secure,
                more reliable and really distributed (more like clustered).
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <span class="info-box-label">Clusterization</span>
                The idea behind <i>Kontalk</i> has always been simple: one
                user account, many servers to connect to. This implies
                collaboration between all servers, including information
                exchange. That's a custom extension to the XMPP protocol
                designed ad-hoc for <i>Kontalk</i>.
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <span class="info-box-label">Security</span>
                Many XMPP extensions are defined for various aspects of chat
                security: message encryption, encrypted channels, and so on.
                All of them requires client-side setup by the user and some
                prior information exchange between clients in order to work.
                Our XMPP extensions define some simple methods, safe enough
                for messaging.
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <span class="info-box-label">How soon?</span>
                Kontalk XMPP is still in a very alpha state. However, both
                server and Android client source code can be found in
                Gitorious. If you feel brave enough you may run the server
                and start using the client by compiling it. A default public
                test server is already built-in in the Android client
                configuration.
